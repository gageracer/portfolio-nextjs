Frustrated with ad-filled Sudoku games, I decided to create my own clean, minimalist solution. Built in just two weeks, Sudokusu is a completely free, privacy-focused Sudoku game with no ads or data collection.

Key features:
- 100% ad-free experience
- Pure client-side implementation
- Zero data collection
- Works offline (PWA-enabled)
- Clean, minimalist design
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Progress saving

Built with:
- SvelteKit for the framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- PWA capabilities for offline play
- Claude AI for grid generation
- LocalStorage for progress saving

I focused on creating a distraction-free experience that respects user privacy. The entire game runs client-side, meaning it works perfectly even without an internet connection once installed as a PWA.
