Quest for Mentors (Q4M) is a student-alumni mentorship platform. Using Angular as a frontend framework for the PWA, the platform matches mentors with mentees based on their needs to create a harmonious community in universities. I built Q4M and submitted it as my thesis project for my bachelor's degree.

- Match-ups junior-senior and senior-alumni,
- Standalone chat panel,
- Quest-like task system to promote users (e.g., certificate for task completion issued by the university administration)
