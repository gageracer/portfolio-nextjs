My latest and greatest web app. It's a note-taking app made with Svelte that is designed for any platform thanks to the PWA features. 
All user data is stored in the local system to prevent personal data leak. Currently, I have been working on it to expand functionalities.

Some features are:
- Compatibility with IOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux,
- Lightening fast processing due to Svelte,
- Has it's own state and routing,
- Easy navigation with a simple design
