My latest and greatest web app. It's a note-taking app that is aimed to be used on any platform,
thanks to PWA features, and is made with Svelte. All the data user has is in the local system so there is no personal data leak. Want to expand it's use cases later. Feature set is:

- Fully cross platform web application (IOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux),
- Super-fast thanks to Svelte,
- Has it's own state and routing,
- Easy to navigate with no busy screen
